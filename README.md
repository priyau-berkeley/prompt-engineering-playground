**Prompt Engineering Notebook** # Used PyTorch and Hugging Face to:
**a. Generate images with Stable Diffusion 1 using text prompts**
Explore how we can use text to instruct a model to generate an image. We'll see how well the model can follow our instructions by asking it to produce specific numbers of objects. 
We'll then use a different model to see if the numbers of objects produced is correct.
**b. Examining the capabilities of Mistral**
Use a recent large language model -- Mistral 7B from Mistral -- to illustrate the benefits of an increase in the number of parameters and how it affects the performance of the model. This model doubles the number or parameters but has also undergone a better pre-training and post-training regime and we would expect that to be reflected in the performance of the model and its ability to follow instructions.
